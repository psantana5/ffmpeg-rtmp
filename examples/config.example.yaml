# ffrtmp CLI Configuration File Example
#
# This file should be placed at: ~/.ffrtmp/config.yaml
#
# The CLI will automatically load this configuration file on startup.
# You can override these settings using command-line flags or environment variables.

# Master server URL (HTTPS recommended for production)
# Environment variable: MASTER_URL
master_url: https://localhost:8080

# API Key for authentication
# Environment variable: MASTER_API_KEY
# Obtain this from your master server administrator
api_key: your-api-key-here

# Alternative key names (for backward compatibility):
# - master: (alias for master_url)
# - token: (alias for api_key)

# Notes:
# - Use HTTPS for production deployments
# - For local development with self-signed certificates, HTTPS to localhost is supported
# - The CLI automatically skips TLS verification for localhost/127.0.0.1
# - For remote hosts, proper TLS certificates are required
