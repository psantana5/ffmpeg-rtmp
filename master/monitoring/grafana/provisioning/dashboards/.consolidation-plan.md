# Dashboard Consolidation Plan

## Current State (10 dashboards, significant overlap)

### Production Operations (Keep & Enhance)
- **production-monitoring**  Keep - Core operational dashboard
  - SLA, job success, bandwidth, resources, cancellations
  
### Redundant Scheduler Dashboards (Consolidate → 1)
- distributed-scheduler (16 panels) - Comprehensive job + scheduler + bandwidth
- scheduler-jobs (6 panels) - Subset of above
- **Action**: Merge into distributed-scheduler, delete scheduler-jobs

### Worker Monitoring (Keep, Remove Overlap)
- worker-monitoring (8 panels) - Detailed worker metrics
- production-monitoring has CPU/Memory panels
- **Action**: Keep worker-monitoring for detailed view, production-monitoring for overview

### Specialized Metrics (Keep as separate)
- cost-analysis (5 panels) - Financial tracking
- qoe-metrics (6 panels) - Quality metrics
- ml-predictions (12 panels) - ML/predictions
- results-overview (5 panels) - Scenario results

### Health/Status (Integrate or Remove)
- exporter-health (5 panels) - Could integrate into production-monitoring
- **Action**: Add exporter health panel to production-monitoring, remove standalone

### Broken/Empty (Delete)
- production-scheduler (0 panels) - Empty
- **Action**: Delete

## Target State (6-7 dashboards, clear purpose)

1. **Production Monitoring** (Enhanced)
   - Overview: SLA, success rate, active jobs, exporter health
   - Resources: CPU, memory, bandwidth
   - Operations: Cancellations, violations

2. **Job Scheduler** (Consolidated from distributed-scheduler + scheduler-jobs)
   - Job states, queue, duration
   - Worker assignments
   - Scheduling performance

3. **Worker Monitoring** (Detailed)
   - Individual worker metrics
   - GPU stats, power, temperature
   - Heartbeats

4. **Cost Analysis** (Specialized)
   - Cost tracking per scenario
   - Energy vs compute

5. **Quality Metrics** (Consolidated QoE + Results)
   - VMAF, PSNR, SSIM scores
   - Frame statistics
   - Scenario comparisons

6. **ML Predictions** (Specialized)
   - Model predictions
   - Training drift
   - Confidence scores

## Implementation Steps

1. Enhance production-monitoring with exporter health panel
2. Delete empty production-scheduler.json
3. Delete redundant scheduler-jobs.json (use distributed-scheduler)
4. Consolidate qoe-metrics + results-overview → quality-metrics.json
5. Keep cost-analysis, ml-predictions, worker-monitoring as-is
6. Update docker-compose (no changes needed - auto-loads all)
7. Remove standalone deployment script (use existing)
